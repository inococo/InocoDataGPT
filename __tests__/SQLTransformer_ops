It's okay to move the (main_SQL) tag to the end, and we can keep the JSON key names consistent across both prompts for simplicity. Here are your revised templates:

Prompt 1:

"Given the Snowflake database table catalog below, create a JSON response containing:

1. A SQL query to {your desired result} (main_SQL).
2. An estimated complexity level of the query from 1 to 5 (complexity_level).
3. If the complexity is greater than 3, a proposed SQL query or an EXPLAIN PLAN command to prune the Snowflake database before running the main SQL (pruning_SQL).
Here's the Snowflake database catalog: [...]"

Prompt 2:

"Given the results of the pruning SQL query and the Snowflake database table catalog, create a JSON response containing:

1. A fine-tuned SQL query to {your desired result} (main_SQL).
2. An estimated complexity level of the new query from 1 to 5 (complexity_level).
3. If the complexity is still greater than 3, a new proposed SQL query or an EXPLAIN PLAN command to further prune the Snowflake database (pruning_SQL).
Here's the Snowflake database catalog and the results from the pruning SQL query: [...]"

Replace {your desired result} with the actual result you are looking for in each case. Remember to keep the formatting and punctuation intact when replacing {your desired result} to ensure correct syntax.
