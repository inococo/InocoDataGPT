Centralized vector store (sharing data) and GPT-4 (knowledge)\n2. Edges: fine-tuned GPT-J and enterprise data warehouses\n\nFederation logic and algorithms:\n1. The vector store contains both private data (like data catalog) and shareable data (like filtered operational data)\n2. The LLM vectors from prompts to GPT-4\n3. Fine-tune GPT-J with vector data\n\nFine-tune GPT-J specifically in three areas:\n1. Froze model with low-rank adapters (LoRA) with 8-bit backbone\n2. Train from knowledge checkpoint (for globally sharing)\n3. Train from vector data checkpoint (for incremental edge)\n\n\nThis notebook is a proof of concept for fine-tuning GPT-J only due to external connectors and resource limitations\n\nGPT-J fine-tuning References:\n* In March 2023, Databricks released Dolly, an Apache-licensed, instruction-following model based on GPT-J with fine-tuning from the Stanford Alpaca dataset: https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html\n* Fine-tuning 6B GPT-J in Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ft6wQU0BhqG5PRlwgaZJv2VukKKjU4Es\n* Fine-tuning GPT-J-6B in Github thread: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14839\n* GPT-J-6B Fine-Tuning with Ray AIR: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/examples/gptj_deepspeed_fine_tuning.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Comment o
